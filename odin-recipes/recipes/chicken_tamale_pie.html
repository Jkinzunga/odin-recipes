    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup fat free milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup egg substitute</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoon taco seasoning, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper</li>
        <li>1 (14 3/4 ounce) can cream-style corn</li>
        <li>1 (8.5 ounce) box corn muffin mix (such as Jiffy)</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can red enchilada sauce I recommend going with an authentic Mexican brand</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cooked chicken breast</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded white cheese </li>
        <li>cilantro and crumbled Cotija cheese for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°. Combine the first 7 ingredients (milk through green chiles), using just 1/2 tablespoon of the taco seasoning, in a large bowl, stirring just until moist. Pour mixture into a round pie plate (mine was glass) coated with cooking spray. Bake for 20-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While corn is baking, toss the chicken in the remaining 1 tablespoon taco seasoning. When corn is done – it will be just barely set and golden brown – pierce entire surface liberally with a fork (it might stick a little bit to the fork). Pour enchilada sauce over top. Top with chicken; sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 400° for 15 minutes or until cheese melts. Remove from oven; let stand 5 minutes. Cut into 8 pieces; top each serving with cilantro and Cotija cheese.</li>
    
    </ol>
